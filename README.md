Tools for the VN 7'sCarlet

Build instructions: 
 * Clone with the `--recurse-submodules` argument
 * Use a C++17 capable compiler that contains std::filesystem (or replace it with boost::filesystem)

You can find more information about the file formats on the [wiki page](https://github.com/Anonym271/7scarlet-tools/wiki).

**Everything is highly WIP**
