101: "I-I made it..."
106: "Oh no...!"
109: "M-Money..."
112: "What should I...?"
117: "Do you want to make a call?"
125: "They say you need money to cross the River Styx.@@But it seems that you don't have any."
129: "...Urgh.@@Please，let me go--"
134: "Are you going to beg for your life?@@Don't make me laugh.@@Sorry，but you don't have the right to beg. No--"
137: "You don't even have a life for which to beg."
140: "......"
144: "Don't think badly of me..."
176: Where is this...?
179: My field of vision is fading in and out.@@I have to wake up...
182: I don't have any strength.@@The heavy scent wafting in the air holds me down.
186: A field of purple.@@I wonder what the origin of the word purple is...@@That trivial thought dominates my consciousness.
190: A distant memory.@@I know it so well，but I can't remember it.@@My vision wavers，and I slowly dissolve.
192: Forever and ever，in a swirl of purple...
209: "Ow!"
212: "What are you doing，spacing out here?"
220: I feel pain，and find myself in the cafeteria.
224: "You were like a lifeless doll@@until I poked you in the forehead，you know?"
233: He says，grinning.@@It's a kind，considerate smile.
238: The one who brought me out of my daydream is@@Hino Kagutsuchi，my classmate.
242: He was transferred to my elementary school.@@We went to the same middle and high school，too.@@Sometimes we were in the same class，but not always.
245: We go to the same college now，too.@@However，it's pure coincidence.
248: "Are you alone?"
258: Hino pulls out a chair without waiting for my reply，@@and plops himself down on it.
265: "My friends invited me，but I turned them down."
272: "I see. Well，that's rude."
279: "You don't even hear what people say@@when you space out like that，do you?"
284: Hearing that，I look around.
306: ...A girl talking about the new cafe nearby.@@A boy groaning about an essay he hasn't finished.@@The tumult of the cafeteria becomes clearer.
309: My daydreams always come suddenly，@@pulling me away from reality.
312: My friends know about my habit of spacing out，@@so it doesn't phase them at all.
315: Once，when I woke from a dream，@@Hino's face was right in front of mine...
323: "Hey，%first?@@You awake?"
327: "Hey，you awake?"
334: "...Geez，there you go，spacing out again.@@Are you that fascinated with my face?"
344: "N-No!"
352: "Well，whatever.@@What，you're eating fish again?@@Eat meat once in a while. It'll give you stamina."
360: "Fish is better for you.@@Plus，it has fewer calories."
367: "I have my club after this.@@I won't make it to supper without enough calories."
373: "You're still playing soccer，huh?"
380: "It's futsal. Well，I guess they seem@@pretty similar to an amateur like you."
386: "It suits you perfectly，Hino."
393: "What's that supposed to mean?@@Aren't all sports basically the same to you?"
399: "Well... it looks like you cheered up a bit."
405: "Oh... Yeah，thanks."
410: I know he's being considerate of me.
416: It's been almost a year since my older brother@@disappeared. The seasons have come and gone.
418: I'm a lot calmer now than I was before，but...
423: Whenever I think about it，@@a grey fog still clouds my heart.@@Hino senses that，and he's always worrying about me.
430: "I heard they closed the investigation."
447: "Would you like to try going there?@@To Okunezato?"
450: Okunezato.@@When I hear that name，my heart starts pounding.
459: Okunezato is a small country town in the mountains.
463: A year ago，my brother wandered into that quiet town@@surrounded by mountains and rivers，@@and a few days later，he went missing.
466: It seems people occasionally go missing while@@climbing the steep mountains around the town.
469: The police decided my brother must have@@had an accident，like so many before him.
472: My brother vanished，as if melting into@@the vast dead-end street that is Okunezato.
481: "Actually，I'd like to go there.@@Which is to say，I made plans to go there."
487: "What do you mean?"
497: "The Okunezato Supernatural Club@@is having an offline meeting in town."
500: The Okunezato Supernatural Club is a website that@@explains the rumors and mysteries of Okunezato.
505: Some of Okunezato's accidents go unexplained，@@so the place is well known by a subset@@of mystery fans，who post comments on the website.
508: I only know about that website@@because of my brother.
511: I occasionally found him researching it@@on his computer.
513: My heart skips a beat again.
520: "The owner of the site decided to hold a meeting；@@I guess it's their first one ever."
528: "Well，it's not like there's really any need@@for them to meet regularly."
536: "So，do you want to come with me?@@It might be more meaningful than@@getting lost in thought all by yourself."
542: "......"
549: "No... I'm kind of scared.@@You go by yourself，Hino."
557: "Hey，are you really okay with that?@@You might not ever get another@@chance like this，you know?"
564: "That's true.@@But it's so sudden... I'm not ready."
567: "But Hino，why--?"
573: "Hm?"
579: "Why are you being so nice to me?"
588: "Why?"
597: "W-Well... No particular reason.@@It's not like I'm doing it just for you."
605: "I mean，I invited you along because@@I want to help you look for your brother，@@but... that's not my only reason..."
608: "It's not?"
613: "No. I mean，I hear the air is nice out there.@@And we could，like，take a nature walk，@@eat together，watch fireworks at night..."
620: "And do，um，other summer vacation-type stuff...@@I mean，there's probably a ton of things to do!"
627: "A ton of summer vacation-type stuff...@@It sounds like you just want to go there to goof off."
637: "Hey，what's with the snide remark?@@Here I am，trying to--"
672: "...Whatever. So，what do you want to do?@@You really don't want to come?"
678: I avert my eyes.@@To be honest，I'm a little scared.
681: But Hino's bubbly personality is cheering me up.@@And more than anything else...
684: I want to see what my beloved brother saw@@with my own two eyes.
699: The buzz of the cafeteria fades from my ears.@@In the silence，I hear only the song of the cicadas.
726: I can't stop my heart from pounding.@@But it stirs me，like some gravitational force.
734: "Hey，you okay? You're spacing out again.@@Here，you want something to drink?"
737: Hino offers me a sports drink in a plastic bottle.@@I take it and drain it in one gulp.
741: If I go to Okunezato，I might figure out@@why my heart is pounding so much.
744: "I want to know what happened to my brother."@@I think，as my fear retreats into the shadows.
751: "......"
754: "...Okay，I'll go."
760: "Yeah?"
764: "I found some courage.@@I think I'll go to Okunezato."
772: "Oh，nice.@@All right，that decides it!@@I'll tell you the dates later. Go pack your stuff."
778: "Yeah，okay."
791: And so，the wheel of fate begins to turn.
